## Weather Forecast Automation with UiPath


# Overview
This project aims to automate the process of retrieving weather forecasts for Berlin, Germany, for the next 14 days using UiPath. The automation eliminates the need for manual checking of weather forecasts, allowing marketing managers, to efficiently plan outdoor events without hassle.

# Use Case
A Marketing Manager in a Company, needs to organize outdoor events in Berlin over the next two weeks. Weather conditions are crucial for selecting suitable event locations and equipment. However, manually checking the weather forecast every day is time-consuming. To streamline the process, this automation extracts weather forecasts from the "https://www.timeanddate.com/weather/germany/berlin/ext" website and sends an email containing the 14-day weather forecast to Marketing Manager inbox.

# Implementation
The automation is developed using UiPath, a Robotic Process Automation (RPA) tool. It navigates to the specified web page, extracts the weather forecast data, and formats it into an email. The email includes information such as minimum and maximum temperatures in Celsius, chance of precipitation, and wind velocity for each day.

# Instructions
Clone or download the project repository.  
Open the UiPath project in UiPath Studio.  
Run the project to extract and send the weather forecast email.

# Dependencies
